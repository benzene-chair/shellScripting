# Bash Notebook Tutorial

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates basic bash commands (`mkdir`, `touch`, `tree`, `cat`, etc.) and exercises for students.

To run the notebook interactively (no installation required), click the Binder button below. This launches a temporary environment with the notebook ready to run.

If the Binder link does not work immediately, try again — Binder builds an image on first use and caches it afterwards.
